        <h1>Similiar Songs & Such</h1>

        <p>
            Sometimes you just hear a song and think, don't I know this song? But you don't, and it just sounds eerily similiar to a song you have heard before, or one you listen to!
            This is something that I have noticed in my small <i>variety</i> of songs that I listen to. It fascinates me how two songs can sound so similar, yet be different and makes me wonder whether the artists took any inspiration?

        <p>
            I have added most of the songs that I have noticed similarity between on this website! Go to the songs tab and take a look!
            While there may not be many, take a listen to a few and see how well you can tell the similarities.
