        <h1>Similar Songs</h1>

        <p>
            Sometimes you just hear a song and think, don't I know this song? But you don't, and it just sounds eerily similiar to a song you have heard before, or one you listen to!
            This is something that I have noticed in my small <i>variety</i> of songs that I listen to. It is fascinating to me how two songs can sound so similar, yet be different and makes me wonder whether the artists took&nbsp;any&nbsp;inspiration?
        </p>

        <h2>Explore</h2>

        <p>
            I have added the songs that I have noticed similarity (and remembered) between on this website! Go to the songs tab and take a look!
            There are not many at the moment, but this should change as I find more similarities in music!
        </p>

        <h2>Why</h2>
        
        <p>
            I made this website so that I can keep track of songs that sound similar to each other. Contrary to the domain name, it is not limited to songs that are perhaps identical, but even just slightly similar.
            For now, the songs are sourced from just myself, but in the future I may consider opening a suggestion form.
